A bug tracking application that utilizes the MVC(Model-View-Controller) design pattern, and implements basic security for user log in.

This application utilizes MySql, JQuery, and PHP for database storage.

The logo was designed by the developer.
Headers, navigation bars are from the Bootstrap library.
Icons are from fontawesome.com (Edition 4)

What I learned making this application:


Setting up php on the Brackets Editor
Learning simple PHP (Format of php code, 'echo,' declaring variables in php, inserting data through an html form (with PHP) to a database, and opening & closing a session)
Using and connecting to a server
Creating and executing SQL statements
Password Hashing(using the password_hash and password_verify functions)
