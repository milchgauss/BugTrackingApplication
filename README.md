A bug tracking application that utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and implements basic security for user sign-up.

This application utilizes MySQL for database storage.

The logo was designed by the developer.
Headers, navigation bars are from the Bootstrap library.
Icons are from fontawesome.com (Edition 4)

What I learned making this application:
Setting up php on the Brackets Editor.
Back-end development using PHP.

Using and connecting to a server (Apache)
Creating and executing SQL statements ($_GET['var'] and $_POST['var'] methods to retrieve and input data in to databases).

Password Hashing(using the password_hash and password_verify functions)

**index.html:**
**FORM VALIDATION**
Includes a responsive form using HTML and Bootstrap for input validation of passwords with a Javascript regular expression using the "pattern" property.
The password entered must be 12 symbols long in length, must include a capital letter, must include a lowercase letter, and must include at least 1 digit from 0-9.
I have also set the "required" attribute to true as usernames and  passwords in the log-in page can not be empty.
