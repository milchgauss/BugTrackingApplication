Create a working database for users that sign up.
Database should include:

Username|First + Last Name| Email | Password| Issue Title| Issue Description| Brief bio! (50 words or less)

When "sign up" is clicked, store username, password, and email in one row.
The issue title and issue description will be stored when the user first posts.

--

The first and last name will also be displayed on bio. -> How to display the user that is signed in?
Learn about sessions.
Connected to a server - > user's name is displayed.

--
Remember to include security measures for the password!

-> Click post issue:

-> Issue list should disappear, and a text box with a "submit" button should appear, and a text field for the
title of the issues should appear. Create a drop down box for the "severity" of the issue, and whether it is
fixed or not. Include a "cancel" button in case the user no longer wants to submit the issue. This button
will switch the div back to the issue table. Nothing changes.

(SEVERE, NOT SEVERE, MODERATE)


-> Make the text box editable (bolded words, italicized words, etc)
-> Allow users to describe the issue.

Once "submit" button is hit:

-> A new row should be added to the table.

-> The table should appear again.
-> The "title" of the issue should appear in the issue" column.
The poster's name, the date that the time the button was hit, and the "severity" that was added to it.
-> Severity "drop down" bar.
Post the severity status in the database based on which button was active at the time the "submit" button was hit.

User's profile:
Retrieve a user's profile from the database.
Allow user to edit their profile photo. Save that photo.
--
My reports:
Give ONLY the list of the posts of the user that is logged in.
-> SELECT username + posts
-> Display these in div boxes created dynamically as the user creates more reports
--
My comments:
Same logic as above, except for user's comments.
